# ArduinoUno_Stopwatch
An Arduino Uno is going to be used for this project to make a simple Stopwatch, which is also able to track time as well as recording it to an SD Card via the SD Module that is going to be used.
The time elapsed will be shown on a 4-digit 7-segment display and the Current time will be shown on a 16x2 LCD Display using RTC module.
Two buttons will be used one to Start/Pause/Continue and one to Stop and save the duration and the time at which it was stopped to the SD card.
